# Login Signup with Dashboard

#### This project is created in Next.js with Typescript and Tailwind css and this is a full stack project.

In this project i have created Signup, Login and Dashboard for a user with verify Email and password recovery after forgotting by providing forgot password and reset password features.

In backend i am using MONGODB database for storing user data and nodemailer for sending emails for verify email and reset password with many other NextJs supported packages Like, mongoose for mongodb, axios for data fetching from backend, bcrypy.js for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for generating token, nodemailer for sending emails and react-hot-toast for showing success and error message with some styling.
